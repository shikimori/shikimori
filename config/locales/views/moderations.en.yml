        - This is the list of top %{limit} most popular animes with
          missing videos.
        - You can get detailed information about missing video by clicking
          corresponding anime in the list.
        - The list is cached by the site and refreshed once per hour.
        - Sometimes only 1-3 episodes of 13-26 ones are shown as available -
          most likely this means that available episodes are from another
          anime (they have been imported from another site automatically
          by mistake). Such episodes should be deleted.

        instruction: Instructions
        instructions:
          - Don't discuss moderation related issues and the fact of you being
            a moderator with other members.
          - Don't discuss your reasons for banning a particular member
            as well as ban duration or why this user has been banned
            while another one has not.
          - Be polite, don't insult or harass other members.
          - Ban duration is set using a combination of minutes (m),
            hours (h), days (d) and weeks (w). E.g. <b><em>5m 2h 3w</em></b>
            is a ban for 3 weeks, 2 hours and 5 minutes.
          - Using zero as ban duration results in warning a member
            without actually banning him or her.
          - 'Ban duration for any particular member is calculated
            automatically using this formula:
            <b><em>0.5 + 0.5 * ((&lt;number_of_bans_for_the_last_two_months&gt; ^ 3) /2 - 1)</em></b>.'
          - Ban duration is left to your discretion but it's recommended to
            use ban duration calculated automatically.
          - Banned users trying to sign up using proxy server
            must be banned without further ado and for a very long time.
            Their comments must be removed.
          - 'Don''t ban for old comments - such comments are tagged with an
            <span style="font-size: 11px; color: green;">
            old comment</span> marker.'
          - Deliberate flaming or trolling is strictly
            prohibited - members starting either one must be banned.

        instructions:
          - 'Anime descriptions must be original that is not "copypasted"
            from other sites. It can be easily checked: just search for
            description in question on
            <a href="https://www.google.ru/search?q=The+End+of+Evangelion+serves+as+an+alternate+ending+to+the+polarizing+final+episodes+of+Neon+Genesis+Evangelion&oq=The+End+of+Evangelion+serves+as+an+alternate+ending+to+the+polarizing+final+episodes+of+Neon+Genesis+Evangelion&aqs=chrome..69i57.662j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8">Google</a>.
            If there''s a full text match on any site besides Shikimori
            this is plagiarism and such content change must be rejected.
            Manga and character descriptions can be quoted from other sites
            provided the source is specified.'
          - Content changes should not have any spelling or grammar mistakes.
            You can spot them with MS Word or any online spell checker
            (e.g. <a href="https://www.jspell.com/public-spell-checker.html">this one</a>).
          - Character names must be <b>highlighted</b> by specifying
            Japanese variant in parentheses right after the name.
          - Descriptions must be authored in literary English.
            Translations verbatim from other languages are forbidden.
          - The author will receive notification after you accept or reject
            his content change. In the latter case try to explain
            what should be fixed for his content change to be accepted.
          - It's not prohibited to replace someone else's description
            completely. All descriptions can be changed by other members
            if moderator considers a new text to be better.
          - 'High quality screenshots are strongly recommended:
            e.g. acceptable resolution for ongoings is 720p (1280x720),
            for older animes - at least 480p (720x480). It''s allowed
            to use poor quality screenshots from animes of the 90s.'
          - Screenshots shouldn't contain any logos or watermarks of
            other sites as well as subtitles.








        instructions_notice: >-
          In case of minor drawbacks it's recommended to accept (rather than
          reject) content change and correct it by yourself if necessary:
          when editing anime/manga/character description you can use
          "Apply" button (it's located to the left of "Save" button)
          to apply changes without adding yourself to the list of authors.
