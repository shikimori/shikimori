      index:
        <<: *defaults
        notice: This is the history of bans and warnings
        instructions:
          - User profiles and clubs are not moderated.
          - Don't discuss moderation related issues and the fact of you being
            a moderator with other members.
          - Don't discuss your reasons for banning a particular member
            as well as ban duration or why this user has been banned
            while another one has not.
          - Be polite, don't insult or harass other members.
          - Ban duration is set using a combination of minutes (m),
            hours (h), days (d) and weeks (w). E.g. <b><em>5m 2h 3w</em></b>
            is a ban for 3 weeks, 2 hours and 5 minutes.
          - Using zero as ban duration results in warning a member
            without actually banning him or her.
          - 'Ban duration for any particular member is calculated
            automatically using this formula:
            <b><em>0.5 + 0.5 * ((&lt;number_of_bans_for_the_last_two_months&gt; ^ 3) /2 - 1)</em></b>.'
          - Ban duration is left to your discretion but it's recommended to
            use ban duration calculated automatically.
          - Banned users trying to sign up using proxy server
            must be banned without further ado and for a very long time.
            Their comments must be removed.
          - 'Don''t ban for old comments - such comments are tagged with an
            <span style="font-size: 11px; color: green;">
            old comment</span> marker.'
          - Deliberate flaming or trolling is strictly
            prohibited - members starting either one must be banned.
